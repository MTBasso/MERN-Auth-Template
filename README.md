## Features

- **User Authentication:** Implement a robust user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless authentication.
  
- **MongoDB Integration:** Utilize MongoDB as the database for storing user information, ensuring data persistence and flexibility.

- **Express.js Backend:** A powerful and minimalist Express.js server to handle API requests, manage routes, and enforce security measures.

- **React Frontend:** A well-organized React frontend that seamlessly integrates with the backend, providing a responsive and dynamic user interface.

- **Scalable Structure:** Follows best practices for project structure, making it easy to scale and maintain your application as it grows.

- **Session Management:** Efficient session management to enhance user experience and maintain user sessions securely.

- **Easy Configuration:** Simple configuration files for quick setup and customization according to your project requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
